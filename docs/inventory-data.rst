Inventory & Data
================

A ``pyinfra`` inventory provides hosts, groups and data. Host are the targets ``pyinfra`` will execute commands or state changes on (think a SSH daemon on a server, a Docker container or the local machine). Hosts can be attached to groups, and data can then be assigned to both the groups of hosts and individual hosts.

By default ``pyinfra`` assumes hosts are SSH servers and the name of the host is used as the SSH hostname. Prefixing the name of the host with ``@<connector-name>/`` is used to activate alternative connectors. See: :doc:`connectors`.

Inventory Files
---------------

Inventory files contain groups of hosts. Groups are defined as a ``list``. For example, this inventory creates two groups, ``app_servers`` and ``db_servers``:

.. code:: python

    app_servers = [
        "app-1.net",
        "app-2.net"
    ]

    db_servers = [
        "db-1.net",
        "db-2.net",
        "db-3.net",
    ]

If you save this file as ``inventory.py``, you can then use it in when executing ``pyinfra``:

.. code:: shell

    pyinfra inventory.py OPERATIONS...

.. Note::
    In addition to the groups defined in the inventory, all the hosts are added to a group with the name of the inventory file (eg ``production.py`` becomes ``production``).

Limiting inventory at runtime
-----------------------------

It is possible to limit the inventory at execution time using the ``--limit`` argument. This makes ``pyinfra`` only execute operations against targets matching the limit. Multiple limits can be provided and a limit may refer to a group or glob-style match against host names. A few examples:

.. code:: shell

    # Only execute against @local
    pyinfra inventory.py deploy.py --limit @local

    # Only execute against hosts in the `app_servers` group
    pyinfra inventory.py deploy.py --limit app_servers

    # Only execute against hosts with names matching db*
    pyinfra inventory.py deploy.py --limit "db*"

    # Combine multiple limits
    pyinfra inventory.py deploy.py --limit app_servers --limit db-1.net

Host Data
---------

Data can be assigned to individual hosts in the inventory by using a tuple ``(hostname, data_dict)``:

.. code:: python

    app_servers = [
        ("app-1.net", {"install_postgres": False}),
        ("db-1.net", {"install_postgres": True}),
    ]

This can then be used in operations files:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import host

    if host.data.get("install_postgres"):
        apt.packages(
            packages=["postgresql-server"],
        )

Group Data Files
----------------

Group data can be stored in separate files under the ``group_data`` directory (there's also a ``--group-data $DIR`` flag). Files will be loaded that match ``group_data/<group_name>.py``, and all hosts in any matching group will receive variables defined in the file as data:

.. code:: python

    app_user = "myuser"
    app_dir = "/opt/pyinfra"

These can then be used in operations:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra import host

    git.repo(
        src="git@github.com:Fizzadar/pyinfra.git",
        dest=host.data.app_dir,
        user=host.data.app_user,
    )

.. Note::
    The ``group_data`` directory is relative to the current working directory. This can be changed at runtime via the ``--chdir`` flag.

Data Hierarchy
--------------

The same keys can be defined for host and group data - this means we can set a default in ``all.py`` and override it on a group or host basis. When accessing data, the first match in the following is returned:

+ "Override" data passed in via CLI args
+ Host data as defined in the inventory file
+ Normal group data
+ "all" group data

.. Note::
    pyinfra contains a ``debug-inventory`` command which can be used to explore the data output per-host for a given inventory/deploy, ie ``pyinfra inventory.py debug-inventory``.

Connecting with Data
--------------------

Data can be used to configure connectors, for example setting SSH connection details can be done like so:

.. code:: python

    ssh_user = "ubuntu"
    ssh_key = "~/.ssh/some_key"
    ssh_key_password = "password for key"

The :doc:`connectors` contains full details of which data keys are available in each connector.

Global Arguments with Data
--------------------------

Data can also provide default values for :doc:`arguments`, for example:

.. code:: python

    _sudo = True
    _sudo_user = "pyinfra"

External Sources for Data
-------------------------

Because ``pyinfra`` is configured in Python, you can pull in data from pretty much anywhere just using other Python packages.
