        By default this is autogenerated as follows (tested/working for OpenBSD):
        ``http://ftp.<OS>.org/pub/<OS>/<VERSION>/packages/<ARCH>/``. Note that OpenBSD's
        official mirrors only hold the latest two versions packages.

        NetBSD/FreeBSD helpfully use their own directory structures, so the default won't
        work.

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        pkg.packages(
            {'Install Vim and Vim Addon Manager'},
            ['vim-addon-manager', 'vim'],
        )

        # Autogenerate package path
        if not pkg_path:
            host_os = host.fact.os or ''
            pkg_path = 'http://ftp.{http}.org/pub/{os}/{version}/packages/{arch}/'.format(
                http=host_os.lower(),
                os=host_os,
                version=host.fact.os_version,
                arch=host.fact.arch,
            )

        packages, host.fact.pkg_packages, present,
        install_command='PKG_PATH={0} pkg_add'.format(pkg_path),
