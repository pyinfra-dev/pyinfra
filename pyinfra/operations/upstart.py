    Manage the state of upstart managed services.

    + running: whether the service should be running
    + restarted: whether the service should be restarted
    + reloaded: whether the service should be reloaded
    + command: custom command to pass like: ``/etc/rc.d/<service> <command>``

    Enabling/disabling services:
        Upstart jobs define runlevels in their config files - as such there is no way to
        edit/list these without fiddling with the config. So pyinfra simply manages the
        existence of a ``/etc/init/<service>.override`` file, and sets its content to
        "manual" to disable automatic start of services.
